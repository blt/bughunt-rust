# rustc bughunt

This project is an attempt to search for bugs in the Rust standard library data
structures via QuickCheck. The broad ambition is inspired by the work of [**@jlouis**](https://github.com/jlouis)
in Erlang -- specifically with regard to the work done on that language's newish
maps construct -- and the work of Shnatsel in Rust more recently.

As of now, we're at a bare proof of concept. Soonish I'll have methodology and
contribution guidelines. For now, welcome friend.
